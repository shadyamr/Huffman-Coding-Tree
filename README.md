# Huffman Coding Tree
Huffman Coding Tree â€” Data Compression Algorithm (C++)

This was a final group project for SWE210 - Data Structures & Algorithms	[FALL 2021]

# About The Project
It is a particular type of optimal prefix code that is commonly used for lossless data compression. The process of finding or using such a code proceeds by means of Huffman coding, an algorithm developed by David A. Huffman. The output from Huffman's algorithm can be viewed as a variable-length code table for encoding a source symbol (such as a character in a file). The algorithm derives this table from the estimated probability or frequency of occurrence (weight) for each possible value of the source symbol.
